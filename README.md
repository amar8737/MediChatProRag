# üè• MediChat Pro: Your Intelligent Medical Document Assistant

**MediChat Pro** is a powerful Streamlit application that acts as a **Medical Document Assistant**. It uses the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern to allow users to upload PDF medical documents, search the content, and get answers grounded strictly in the provided files.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-PDF Upload:** Easily upload one or more PDF medical documents via the sidebar.
* **RAG Implementation:** Uses LangChain components for text extraction, chunking, vector storage, and context-aware querying.
* **FAISS Vector Store:** Efficiently indexes document content for fast, relevant retrieval.
* **Euri AI Integration:** Utilizes the `gpt-4.1-nano` model (via Euri AI) to generate answers based on retrieved context.
* **Chat Interface:** Provides a dynamic chat experience to interact with the processed documents.
* **Custom Styling:** Enhanced UI/UX using Streamlit's custom markdown and CSS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run MediChat Pro locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* An **Euri AI API Key**
* The necessary libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` (see next section).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-link>
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**
    Based on the imports, your project requires the following libraries. Create a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    streamlit
    langchain
    python-dotenv
    # Libraries likely used in your utility files (app/...)
    pypdf
    faiss-cpu
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Setup Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named **`.ENV`** in your project root directory and add your Euri AI API key:
    ```
    # .ENV
    EURI_API_KEY="your_euri_ai_api_key_here"
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure the utility files (`app/ui.py`, `app/pdf_utils.py`, etc.) are correctly implemented in an `app` directory.**

2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run main_app.py 
    # Replace main_app.py with the name of your main Python file (where your provided code lives).
    ```

3.  The application will open in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üìñ Usage Guide

1.  **Upload Documents:** Use the **`üìÅ Document Upload`** section in the sidebar to browse and upload one or more medical PDF files.
2.  **Process Documents:** Click the **`üöÄ Process Documents`** button. The application will:
    * Extract text from all uploaded PDFs.
    * Split the combined text into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
    * Create a **FAISS vector store** from these chunks.
    * Initialize the `gpt-4.1-nano` chat model.
    * A **`‚úÖ Documents processed successfully!`** message will confirm readiness.
3.  **Chat with Documents:** In the main chat area, type your questions related to the content of your medical documents (e.g., "What does my latest lab report say about my glucose level?", "What is the dosage of the prescribed medication?").
4.  **Get Contextual Answers:** The assistant will retrieve the most relevant information from your documents, use it as context, and provide an accurate answer. If the information is not present, it will inform you.
